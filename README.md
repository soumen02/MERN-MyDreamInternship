# Welcome to MyDreamInternship 
~ _Your one stop destination to finding the internship of your dreams!_

### About Our Project

We are building a super app for students to find internships at their dream companies - by creating applications, tracking them, and looking for open vacancies. Many students don't know how to search for companies and apply to their internships. So, we aim to make this process easier. We catalog the best internships one can find (along with details about the companies) from all over the internet for our users. They will be able to manage their application documents - like CVs and cover letters - while keeping track of their applications to the internships. 


### Our App will offer the following:

* An up-to-date catalog of open internships
* A simplified user interface to search and filter for open roles by date, company or position
* An overview of the companies offering the internships important information like benefits
* Dashboard for tracking applications with appropriate deadlines and statuses
* Centralized management for all past, current and upcoming applications 
* A User Profile section which will act like a CV or resume

### Our Story

This project was proposed by Zulfkhar, who had once struggled with finding internships. The other team members could relate with this difficulty and were excited to take up the challenge. Its the end of keeping track of your career on google docs, notes and sticky notes.
